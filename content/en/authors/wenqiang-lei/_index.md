Published dozens of long papers in top-tier conferences and journals, including CCF-A (China Computer Federation Category A) papers, with several first-authored papers exceeding 100 citations in a short period, becoming mainstream references in the field internationally. A corresponding-authored paper received the Best Paper Award at ACM 2020, the premier international multimedia conference (selected from 1,700 submissions). Collaborated with world-leading scholars such as Professor Maarten de Rijke, a fellow of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences, to deliver three-hour tutorials on "Conversational Recommender Systems" at top-tier international conferences SIGIR2020 and Recsys2021. The SIGIR2020 tutorial alone attracted over 1,600 attendees, setting a record for the highest attendance.

Served as (senior) program committee member for major top-tier international conferences such as ACL, KDD, AAAI, IJCAI, WSDM, and EMNLP. Acted as the Dialogue Area Chair for ACL 2023, Program Committee Chair for the Singapore National Natural Language Processing Conference SSNLP2021, and Workshop Chair for the IEEE-affiliated international conference DSS 2022. Served as a guest editor for the prestigious journal ACM Transactions on the Web and as a reviewer for top-tier domestic and international journals, including IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, and Science China: Information Sciences.
