Graduated from the College of Computer Science at Nankai University in 2020 with a Ph.D. degree and was awarded the ACM Tianjin Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation. Since April 2021, she has been working at the College of Computer Science, Sichuan University, where she currently serves as an Associate Researcher and Master's Supervisor.

Her main research areas include Natural Language Processing, Computational Musicology, Knowledge Graphs, and Process Knowledge Understanding and Applications, with a particular focus on data mining and representation in complex application scenarios, as well as knowledge understanding and reasoning.

She has published over ten papers in top-tier international conferences and journals such as ACM MM and ACL. Her first-authored long paper at ACMMM2020 was selected as the sole "Best Paper" out of approximately 1,700 submissions. She has also served as a program committee member or reviewer for top-tier international conferences and journals such as KDD and TMM.

She has led various projects, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China Youth Science Fund, sub-projects of the National Key R&D Program, the Sichuan Natural Science Foundation General Program, the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation General Program (First-Class), and the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Pre-Station Program, among others.
