abstract: "Evaluating conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems is a challenging task that requires a significant amount of human labor for annotation. It is imperative to invest significant effort into researching more labor-effective methods for evaluating CIR systems. To touch upon this challenge, we take the first step to involve active testing in CIR evaluation and propose a novel method, called HomCoE. It strategically selects a few data for human annotation, then calibrates the evaluation results to eliminate evaluation biases. As such, it makes an accurate evaluation of the CIR system at low human labor. We experimentally reveal that it consumes less than 1% of human labor and achieves a consistency rate of 95%-99% with human evaluation results. This emphasizes the superiority of our method over other baselines."
