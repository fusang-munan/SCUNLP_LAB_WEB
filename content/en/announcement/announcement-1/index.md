From November 1 to 3, 2025, the 4th National Conference on Large Model Generative Intelligence (LMG 2025) was grandly held in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. Hosted by the Special Committee on Large Models and Generation of the Chinese Information Processing Society of China (CIPS) and undertaken by Sichuan University, the conference was organized by the College of Computer Science (College of Software, College of Intelligent Science and Technology) of Sichuan University. With the theme "Intelligence Gathers in Tianfu, Forging a Generative Artistic Realm", it focused on cutting-edge explorations and key technological breakthroughs in the field of generative intelligence.

## Opening Ceremony

On the morning of November 1, the conference officially opened. Mr. Lu Songming, Secretary of the Party Leadership Group and Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Science and Technology, attended the opening ceremony and extended warm congratulations.

Professor Sun Le, Researcher of the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Secretary-General of the Chinese Information Processing Society of China (CIPS), Professor Zhang Min, Director of the Special Committee on Large Models and Generation, and Professor Zhang Yue, Chairman of the Program Committee, attended the opening ceremony and delivered speeches. Professor Lü Jiancheng, Chairman of the Program Committee and Dean of the College of Computer Science, as well as many academicians and experts, attended the opening ceremony. The entire opening ceremony was hosted by Professor Lei Wenqiang, Chairman of the Organization Committee.

## Main Forum Keynote Reports

After the opening ceremony, Academician Hu Shimin of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Professor of Tsinghua University delivered an invited report titled "Evaluation Benchmarks and Reflections on the Reasoning Ability of Large Models". The report systematically presented cutting-edge scientific research achievements and provided important theoretical guidance and practical reference for promoting the prosperity of the domestic large model ecosystem.

In the invited report session, Professor Wen Jirong from Renmin University of China, Professor Zhou Haihong from the Central Conservatory of Music, Yang Zhenhua from Huawei Cloud, Professor Wang Liwei from Peking University, Professor Iryna Gurevych (Former President of ACL), and Professor Yulan He from King's College London, together with other scholars and industry representatives, delivered invited reports. They systematically discussed key issues and development directions faced by large models in moving towards general artificial intelligence from multiple perspectives including capability boundaries, human cognition differences, engineering implementation, machine learning theories, and human-machine collaboration.

## AI for Arts Achievement Exhibition

After the main forum, the conference organized an "AI for Arts" Achievement Exhibition and Performance, presented by Professor Lei Wenqiang's team from the College of Computer Science and the Sichuan Symphony Orchestra.

The concert was co-planned by Professor Lei Wenqiang and international conductor Darrell Ang, featuring distinguished artists such as lyric soprano Wu Bixia and erhu performer Zhu Lin. The AI visual creation was completed by undergraduates led by Professor Lei Wenqiang within one month. The exhibition demonstrated the profound involvement of artificial intelligence in emotional construction, stage language design, and artistic form innovation, marking that artistic creation has entered a new stage of "inspiration symbiosis".

## Sub-forums and Technical Workshops

In addition to the main forum, the conference set up 16 thematic sub-forums on large models and 4 cutting-edge technology workshops, inviting over 100 experts and scholars to deliver academic reports. Topics covered cutting-edge directions such as large model foundations, embodied intelligence, and humanistic artistic intelligence. The conference received nearly 160 poster submissions and attracted nearly 1,000 representatives from academia and industry.
