From November 1 to 3, 2025, the 4th National Conference on Large Model Generative Intelligence (LMG 2025) was grandly held in Chengdu, Sichuan Province. Hosted by the Special Committee on Large Models and Generation of the Chinese Information Processing Society of China (CIPS) and undertaken by Sichuan University, the conference was organized by the College of Computer Science (College of Software, College of Intelligent Science and Technology) of Sichuan University. With the theme "Intelligence Gathers in Tianfu, Forging a Generative Artistic Realm", it focused on cutting-edge explorations and key technological breakthroughs in the field of generative intelligence. During the conference, many academicians, renowned experts and scholars at home and abroad, as well as leading figures in the industry, delivered invited reports at the main forum, systematically sharing the latest research achievements and practical experience. Meanwhile, 16 thematic sub-forums on large models and 4 cutting-edge technology workshops were held, inviting more than 100 experts and young scholars to conduct in-depth exchanges. The conference attracted nearly 1,000 experts and scholars from across the country, facilitating full collision of ideas and extensive exchange of achievements, and building a high-level academic exchange platform for promoting the development and application innovation of generative intelligence technology.

Professor Sun Le, Researcher of the Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Secretary-General of the Chinese Information Processing Society of China (CIPS), Professor Zhang Min, Director of the Special Committee on Large Models and Generation and Distinguished Assistant to the President of Harbin Institute of Technology (Shenzhen), and Professor Zhang Yue, Chairman of the Program Committee of the Conference and Professor of Westlake University, attended the opening ceremony and delivered speeches. They introduced and exchanged views on the development of the society, the preparation and organization of the conference, and fully affirmed the work done by Sichuan University for the smooth convening of the conference.
Professor Lü Jiancheng, Chairman of the Program Committee of the Conference and Dean of the College of Computer Science of Sichuan University, as well as many academicians, experts and scholars, attended the opening ceremony. The entire opening ceremony was hosted by Professor Lei Wenqiang, Chairman of the Organization Committee of the Conference and Professor of the College of Computer Science of Sichuan University.
After the opening ceremony, Academician Hu Shimin of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Professor of Tsinghua University delivered an invited report titled "Evaluation Benchmarks and Reflections on the Reasoning Ability of Large Models". The report not only systematically presented cutting-edge scientific research achievements, but also reflected profound insights into the wave of artificial intelligence development. Academician Hu's sharing provided important theoretical guidance and practical reference for promoting the prosperity of the domestic large model ecosystem and building the computing power foundation for the new industrial revolution.

After the main forum, the conference specially organized an "AI for Arts" Achievement Exhibition and Performance, which was a immersive stage practice integrating technology and music, co-presented by Professor Lei Wenqiang's team from the College of Computer Science of Sichuan University and the Sichuan Symphony Orchestra. The concert was co-planned by Professor Lei Wenqiang and international conductor Darrell Ang, with the participation of many artists including lyric coloratura soprano Wu Bixia and erhu performer Zhu Lin. Among them, the AI visual creation was completed by undergraduates led by Professor Lei Wenqiang within one month. The exhibition demonstrated the in-depth participation of artificial intelligence in emotional construction, stage language shaping and artistic form innovation. Large model technology has evolved from an "auxiliary tool" to a "co-creation partner", highlighting the great potential of AI in the field of future artistic creation and generation, and marking that artistic creation has entered a new stage of "inspiration symbiosis".
