We warmly congratulate the two 2022-grade master students of Professor Lei Wenqiang's research group on their outstanding achievements. During the autumn recruitment, both Zhang Tong and Chen Yue have successfully secured over 10 SSP+ offers and talent program offers from major tech companies including Tencent, ByteDance, Alibaba, Ant Group, and Xiaohongshu.

In the autumn recruitment, major company offer tiers generally range from senior positions to high, SSP tier, SSP+ tier, and talent program. Among them, SSP+ tier and talent program offers are particularly rare and represent the highest level of recruitment that companies can offer, regardless of whether it's considering salary expectations or assessing recruitment difficulty.
